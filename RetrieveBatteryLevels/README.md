# Retrieve Battery Levels

Manually retrieve the battery levels of your devices and sensors on-demand. If you have a lot of battery operated devices, rather than trying to view the battery levels one at a time, manually initiate this SmartApp and you will get a push notification for each device with it's current battery level.
